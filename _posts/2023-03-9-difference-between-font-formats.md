There are several ways to reduce the app size in Android Studio:

1. Use ProGuard: ProGuard is a tool that can be used to reduce the size of your app's code by removing unused classes and methods, as well as obfuscating the remaining code to make it harder to reverse engineer.

2. Optimize images: Images can take up a significant amount of space in your app. To reduce their size, you can use tools like Photoshop or GIMP to compress them without compromising their quality.

3. Use vector graphics: Vector graphics are resolution-independent, which means they can be scaled up or down without losing quality. This can significantly reduce the size of your app.

4. Remove unnecessary libraries: Make sure to only include the libraries that you need in your app. Unnecessary libraries can bloat your app's size.

5. Compress data: You can use compression algorithms like GZIP to compress data before storing it in your app, reducing the amount of storage space it takes up.

6. Split APKs: Using Android App Bundle and splitting the APK into smaller ones for each architecture, language or feature can help reduce the overall size of the app.

By implementing these methods, you should be able to reduce your app's size and improve its performance.
